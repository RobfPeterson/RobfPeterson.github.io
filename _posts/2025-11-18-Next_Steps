I am still trying to understand. 

During this week, I thought I had finally got a hand on my Honors Calculus class. While I have a better idea of how to pace my self on a week to week basis to complete my work, to have time for spaced repition and more practice, I am struggling with something fundemental in my understanding. 

I am not understanding every concept put infront of me. It has happened before, but in this case, it doesn’t feel like something I can just brute force my way through. I cannot just do more calculations to learn how to solve proofs more efficient. I am not quite sure how to jump from computational skills to logical skills in math, and more importantly, how to practice that jump. I need to engage a different part of my brain which is not used to challenging itself in this context.

Additionally, I also feel like I am at a impasse on my focus. I believe I have had too many bad habits to afford with my ambitions. As such, I need to start cutting those habits. 

This will be a bit of a public commitment towards that goal. I may try other incentives in the future, but I need to try something.
