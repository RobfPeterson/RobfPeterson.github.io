This is a bit of a test run. I pulled the repo for this site and did most of the set up late on Sunday last week. Almost a week later, I am still not fully sure on my intent for this project. I think it will be mostly for infrequent posts when I have a smart thought, and a place to chronicle what I have done so far. Hopefully, this site will become something more... anything. Then again, that's thinking too far ahead. The only way to learn is by doing, the only way to grow is by learning, and the only way to begin, is by beginning.
